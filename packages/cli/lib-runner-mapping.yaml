# Mapping between @mimicprotocol/lib-ts versions and runner versions
# Only add new entries when there are breaking changes between lib-ts and runner
#
# Format:
#   - libVersionRange: semver range (e.g., ">=0.0.1-rc.1 <0.1.0")
#     runnerVersion: semver version (e.g., "1.0.0")
#
# Example with multiple entries:
#   - libVersionRange: ">=0.0.1-rc.1 <0.1.0"
#     runnerVersion: "1.0.0"
#   - libVersionRange: ">=0.1.0"
#     runnerVersion: "2.0.0"
