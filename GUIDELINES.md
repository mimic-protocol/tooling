# Engineering Guidelines

## Testing

Code must be thoroughly tested with quality unit tests. Every addition or change to the code must come with relevant and comprehensive tests.

Tests should be written, not only to verify correctness of the target code, but to be comprehensively reviewed by other programmers. Therefore, the quality of the tests are just as important (if not more so) than the code itself, and should be written with the highest standards of clarity and elegance.

Refactors should avoid simultaneous changes to tests.

Flaky tests are not acceptable.

The test suite should run automatically for every change in the repository, and in pull requests tests must pass before merging.

The test suite coverage must be kept as close to 100% as possible, enforced in pull requests.

To cover different scenarios nested `context` blocks convention is followed to organize the test suit in a readable way.

## Code style

The code should be simple and straightforward, prioritizing readability and understandability. Consistency and predictability should be maintained across the codebase. In particular, this applies to naming, which should be systematic, clear, and concise.

The code should be written in a consistent format enforced by a linter.

Modularity should be pursued, but not at the cost of the above priorities.

## Documentation

Inline documentation is extremely required to properly describe what was the intention of the developer behind each part of the code added.

Project guidelines and processes must be documented publicly in [docs.mimic.fi](https://docs.mimic.fi).

In this case, documentation should include answers to common questions, solutions to common problems, and recommendations for critical decisions that the user may face.

## Peer review

All changes must be submitted through pull requests and go through peer code review.

The review must be approached by the reviewer in a similar way as if it was an audit of the code in question (but importantly it is not a substitute for and should not be considered an audit).

Reviewers should enforce code and project guidelines.

External contributions must be reviewed separately by multiple maintainers.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are squash-merged to keep the `main` branch history clean. The title of the pull request becomes the commit message, so it should be written in a consistent format:

1) Begin with a capital letter.
2) Do not end with a period.
3) Start with the name of the package or core you're contributing to: Lib, CLI, Chore, etc. 
4) Write in the imperative: "Implement feature X" and not "Implements feature X" or "Implemented feature X".

This repository does not follow conventional commits, so do not prefix the title with "fix:" or "feat:".

Work in progress pull requests should be submitted as Drafts and should not be prefixed with "WIP:".

Branch names don't matter, and commit messages within a pull request mostly don't matter either, although they can help the review process.
